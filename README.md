This is a boiler plate setup that has React, redux, Bootstrap, SASS, and webpac-dev-server.

Notes:

No react-router installed, if you install it, for browser history, add this to your webpack-dev-server script: . --history-api-fallback


When you want to deploy, don't forget to build it with npm build.
